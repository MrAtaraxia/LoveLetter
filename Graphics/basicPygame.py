Think about adding...

- Cards

- On hover for cards

- Try it as On click, move to top right corner.

- Figure out how to adjust other things when that one is going.
AKA moving the cards to show that one better.

- Figure out the stupid border thing.

- Look for the Border button thing. I might want that again.

- Find my old dragging around mechanics.

- What graphics do I want to use for this?


ALSO:

- Look into garbage collection!

It should be interesting to do that.

ALSO:

- Look into how to remove something else from the stack!
C calls A calls B. B removes A from the stack so after B finishes C continues
