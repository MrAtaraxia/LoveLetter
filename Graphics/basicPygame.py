Think about adding...

- Cards

- On hover for cards

- Try it as On click, move to top right corner.

- Figure out how to adjust other things when that one is going.
AKA moving the cards to show that one better.

- Figure out the stupid border thing.

- Look for the Border button thing. I might want that again.

- Find my old dragging around mechanics.

- What graphics do I want to use for this?
